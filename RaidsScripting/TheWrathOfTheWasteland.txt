The Wrath of the Wasteland

Stage 0 - The start :
<Guide> Recently fellow villager been reporting massive earthquake in the wasteland, I fear the that heart of the wasteland is angry again.
<Infinity Traveler> You are right, the core is mad again and want to destroy the world, make sure that it won't happen at any cost
<Guide> You'll have to defeat it, terrarian. But you'll first need some preparation in order to proceed

Stage 1 - The wasteland infection
<Guide> Some sort of overgrowth was seen in the jungle, do you think you can check that?

At 100 block away
<Infinity Traveler> I can feel it, it's closer, continue to search around
<Heart of the wasteland> COME CLOSER, WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU, YOU'LL BE CONSUMMED LIKE WE DID

On engaging the overgrowth
<Heart of the wasteland> YOU CANNOT DESTROY US, WE ARE ONE TO THE WORLD
<Infinity Traveler> Ugh, this thing is actually stronger than last time, kill the overgrowth and get it's vine, it might be useful
<Heart of the wasteland> WE GOT DEFEATED ONCE BY A TRAVELLER, I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

When overgrowth is at 50% health
<Infinity Traveler> It's good, I can feel being weaker...
<Heart of the Wasteland> STOP!
<Infinity Traveler> Don't stop and don't let it take control of your mind.

When overgrowth is defeated 
<Heart of the Wasteland> I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU, IT'S ONLY THE START OF THE END, YOU'LL PAY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
<Infinity Traveler> Good job terrarian, this overgrowth is no longer a treat for now, now report it back to {GUIDE NAME}

Stage 2 - The preparation
<Guide> Good job on taking down the overgrowth, it could have been a real treats to the world.
<Infinity Traveler> Take those hardened vine, they will come handy, I found them on the overgrowth.
<Guide> So now that the overgrowth has been defeated, get into the wasteland and casuse some trouble

Once into the wasteland
<Infinity Traveler> Start killing some tracer, it might get the core attention

After 50 tracer being killed 
<Heart of the Wasteland> TERRARIAN, I CAN FEEL MY MINION BEING KILLED, YOU WILL REGRET YOUR ACTION
<Infinity Traveler> Good, we can get out, next go to the crimson, wasteland creature had been seen there, maybe an overgrowth is there.

In crimson
<Infinity Traveler> Now find that overgrowth and make it stop, it's becoming a real treat to the world.
<Heart of the Wasteland> SPREAD, DESTROY

On destroying the overgrowth
<Heart of the Wasteland> NOW WE ARE ANGRY
<Infinity Traveler> That did it, the core is now distracted, get back to the guide to report it.

Stage 3 - The Heart of the Wasteland
<Guide> Good job on destroying that overgrowth...

Player get teleported to the heart of the wasteland and see it's eye opening
<Heart of the Wasteland> YOU MADE US GO OUT OF SLEEP, NOW YOU'LL JOIN US LIKE THE OTHER
<Heart of the Wasteland> TERRARIAN, AS THE KINF OF THE WASTELAND I SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH
<Infinity Traveler> That cannot be good at all, calm it fast before it cause more damage, this weapon might help you.

Fight start
During fight:
<Heart of the Wasteland> JOIN US, WE CAN ALL MAKE A WHOLE FAMILY AGAIN
<Heart of the Wasteland> WE ARE MADE FROM THE SAME FLESH, WE USED TO BE A FAMILLY BUT NOW I AM THIS HORROR

at 75% health
<Heart of the Wasteland> STOP! S T O P! YOU WON'T PUT US BACK INTO SLEEP

at 50% health 
<Heart of the Wasteland> FOOL, YOU CAN'T STOP US, WE ARE BILLION

at 25% health
<Heart of the Wasteland> THIS CAN'T BE POSSIBLE

Upon defeat
<Heart of the Wasteland> Thanks terrarians, I can finally get back to sleep...
<Infinity Traveler> That was a close one.
