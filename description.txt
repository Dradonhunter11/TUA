[c/8B0000:Terraria Ultra Apocalypse]

"Thousands of years ago, there were 2 races, the gods and the humans. The gods freely terrorized the humans as much as they wanted, with many gods implementing weapons of destruction, torturing, and even using humans as guinea pigs in vile experiments. The humans had technology and even their own magic, but it wasn't enough. But one day, a human had enough of it and went to the search of a way to seal the gods. Through the power of their will, the group traveled between dimensions, explored multiple worlds, and braved the worst biomes, until they finally defeated the highest of gods and sealed him. Without the power of their fearless leader, the demonic deities fled the land, and humans rejoiced. Thanks to the ravages of time, the names of these heroes has been forgetten, and even the name of their order has been lost. But my father, his father before him, and all the fathers in the sky above knew, that one day, the descendant of the mighty hero would one day come in a dark hour to defeat the gods again. I believe that that descendant stands before me now." - The Guide
